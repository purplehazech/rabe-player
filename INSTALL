this is a minimal install for running mixxx in the studio with tracks hosted
on the server (or testwise on an external USB HD). It is based on stock gentoo
and some packages from the pro-audio overlay.

files i hacked so far

- /etc/localtime
- /etc/conf.d/hostname
- /etc/hosts
- /etc/portage/*
- /etc/make.conf (added layman and select few global configs)

i plan on keeping this a minimal as possibble and to document complex stuff enough
so that it will be easy to puppetize this to a useable level. puppetization should
start as sonn as i have the kernel sorted out.

for now the machine contains her own portage tree since thas was easier during 
install seeing that punk, my old home machine, is broken.

the kernel setup is somewhat trimmed down for ICH6 based machines since that is what 
rabe has throughout but i plan on trimming down more of the kernel.

the kernel is built using genkernel and i haven't gotten round to doing much boottime
optimizations as of now. I opted for gentoo since i plan on adding earlyboot splashes
at some stage in this build and i figured that might make it easier later.

it seems fs-cache might help in solvng the ocal data qos problems we are experiencing
and i will try that down the line
